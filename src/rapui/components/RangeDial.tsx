/* ══ liquid ═══════════════════════════════════════════════
   Shared parts for the Framer Motion layer: one spring, one
   goo filter, one velocity→skew binding.

   ── why the filter is a hook ────────────────────────────
   The filter is embedded in each component's own return, but
   its id CANNOT be a literal. Every block here renders twice
   at once — once in the wall card, once in the detail overlay
   — and duplicate SVG ids do not scope, they collide: the
   second instance silently steals the first one's filter.
   useId() gives each mount its own name.

   ── what the goo can and cannot do ──────────────────────
   This is feGaussianBlur + feColorMatrix, not a shader. The
   matrix multiplies alpha by `cut` and subtracts half of it,
   so alpha below 0.5 lands on zero and everything above 0.536
   is fully opaque. That hard edge is what fuses nearby shapes
   into one blob — and it is also why this must never touch
   text: glyph antialiasing lives entirely below 0.5, so type
   under this filter loses its edges and then itself. */

/* the elastic, as specified: ζ = 14 / (2·√(220·0.5)) ≈ 0.67,
   so it overshoots about 6% before it settles. A deliberate
   bounce, not a wobble. */
const LIQUID = {
  type: "spring" as const,
  stiffness: 220,
  damping: 14,
  mass: 0.5,
};

/* ── inlined from lab/Gooey ──────────────────────── */
/* ══ Gooey ════════════════════════════════════════════════
   What is left of the two library-surfaced components that
   used to live here: the measurement every liquid-gooey group
   on the bench needs. Liquid tabs and the Plus menu are gone;
   this is the part of them that turned out to be the reusable
   half, and Balance, the Selection list, the Humidity wheel
   and the Sleep dial all still call it.

   ── what the library actually does ──────────────────────
   The usual gooey effect runs blur + alpha-contrast over your
   real UI, which is why it is normally confined to decorative
   circles: text goes soft, images smear, and the contrast step
   eats shadows. liquid-gooey splits it in two. An SVG layer
   carries a silhouette of your elements and takes the whole
   filter; your actual DOM rides crisp on top of it, untouched.
   Same liquid, none of the tax — and it is the same discipline
   our own filter needs, since text under an alpha threshold
   loses its edges and then itself.

   ── the two patterns, which are not interchangeable ─────
   MORPH gives the library the position: pass x/y and it
   animates the element and the liquid together, so pieces that
   separate stay bridged until the goo can no longer hold them.
   The split IS the effect.

   MOVE gives the position to you: move the element however you
   like and the surface trails it as liquid rubber with a
   droplet tail. A filter has no memory of motion — a shape
   that crossed two pixels and one that crossed the whole track
   arrive identical — and this is the part that fixes that. */

/* ── the zoom correction, applied to someone else's SVG ──────
   liquid-gooey measures its items with getBoundingClientRect
   and draws them as SVG user units. Those are the same number
   only while no ancestor is scaled — and on this bench every
   component sits inside a scaled card, so the transform lands
   twice and the silhouette drifts from its element in
   proportion to both the scale and the distance from the
   origin. Measured: 0.1px at scale 1, 22px at 1.09, 124px at
   1.4.

   Everything the library computes is in screen px, so scaling
   its layer by 1/k converts the whole coordinate space back to
   layout px in one move, and the card's own transform then
   renders it correctly. Same k = rect.width / offsetWidth the
   rest of the bench uses.

   MOVE ONLY. Morph positions its items with a CSS transform on
   a real wrapper, in layout px, which scales correctly on its
   own — apply this there and you over-correct: the silhouette
   comes out 1/k the size of its button, so the blob is smaller
   than the element and every icon looks off-centre inside it.
   Measured on the plus menu: button 58px, blob 46px, and up to
   10px of offset. Without it, 58 and 58, dead on. */

/* ══ 1 · sleep, a two handle arc ══════════════════════════
   Same tick language as the humidity wheel, but the value is
   a range rather than a point, so the ticks fill between the
   two handles and the drag picks whichever handle is nearer.

   ── NO PANE ─────────────────────────────────────────────
   It used to sit on a .gcard: a frosted 388px block with a
   title in the corner. The block was doing nothing the dial
   could not do for itself — a ring of ticks is already a
   shape, and putting a rectangle round it only said "this is
   a component" to a page that has already said so with a
   card. The wheel stands in the section on its own now.

   What the pane WAS doing, quietly, was supplying contrast.
   Everything here is drawn in ink at low opacity, and the
   frosted panel sat a step lighter than the wall behind it,
   so 0.13 was enough for an unlit tick. Straight onto the
   card's grey it is not — hence the raised floors below. The
   pane was load-bearing for legibility even though it was
   decoration for layout, which is the usual way a background
   turns out to matter.

   ── the handles are DOM, not SVG ────────────────────────
   They were <circle>s inside the dial. They are elements over
   it now, because liquid-gooey works on rendered rects and
   cannot see into an SVG — and the merge is worth the move:
   when the two handles come together the goo bridges them, so
   a sleep window closing to nothing reads as one body rather
   than as two discs overlapping. The ticks stay in the SVG,
   where they belong: a 2px stroke under a goo filter is a
   stroke the alpha step erases. */
