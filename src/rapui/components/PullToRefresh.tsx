/* ══ elastic blocks ═══════════════════════════════════════
   Two of them here; Palette and Drop each outgrew two hundred
   lines and took a file of their own. The accordion that used
   to sit at the bottom of this file is gone.

   The rule they all keep, and the one worth stating once:
   ELASTICITY IS FEEDBACK, NEVER LATENCY. Every outcome here
   has already happened by the time anything is settling. The
   range's values are correct while the handle is still
   catching up to them, the accordion is open the instant it
   is pressed, and the pull refreshes on release rather than
   when the droplet stops wobbling. A spring that gates a
   result is not liquid, it is lag with a curve on it. */

/* ── inlined from lab/spring ──────────────────────── */
/* ── one spring, for everything that settles ───────────────
   The maths was already on this bench twice, copied by hand:
   Humidity's wheel and Brightness's column both accumulate
   velocity toward a target, damp it, and snap when both the
   delta and the velocity fall under 0.02. Two copies is a
   coincidence; five would be a policy, so it comes out here
   before the elastic blocks are written against it.

   The two shipped copies are deliberately NOT refactored onto
   this. They work, they are tuned, and rewriting the innards
   of two live components to prove a point about duplication
   is how a good afternoon becomes a bad one. This is the one
   new code uses.

   Frames, not milliseconds. `dt` is expressed in sixtieths of
   a second and the damping is RAISED to it rather than
   multiplied by it, so a dropped frame decays the same amount
   of energy as the two frames it replaced. Multiplying is the
   version that makes a spring behave differently on a busy
   page, which is the hardest kind of bug to see.

   The loop parks itself the moment the value has settled.
   CLAUDE.md is not complimentary about the one permanent
   requestAnimationFrame already on this bench and there is no
   case for five more. */

/* 0..100 into the two numbers a spring actually has.

   50 is what Humidity and Brightness were tuned at, which is
   the rule every elastic knob on this bench follows — see
   lab/motion. Turn the panel to the middle and nothing has
   changed.

   Both ends have to be usable, which is what fixes the range:
   at 0 it is slow and heavy and still arrives, at 100 it is
   quick with a visible overshoot, and nowhere in between does
   it ring for longer than it takes to read. */
/* The pair is chosen by DAMPING RATIO and then written back
   as stiffness and decay, because the ratio is the thing a
   person is actually setting and the two numbers on their own
   do not say what they add up to.

     zeta = -ln(d) / (2 * sqrt(k))

   The first version of this ran 0.06..0.26 stiffness against
   0.93..0.74 decay, which reads as a sensible spread and is
   not one: it puts zeta between 0.15 and 0.16 across the
   WHOLE range, so every setting overshot by about sixty per
   cent and the knob only changed how fast it did it. Pull's
   return went 130px past its own resting position and lifted
   the content off the top of the card.

     0   → zeta ~0.85, heavy, arrives without a ring
     50  → zeta ~0.41, near where Humidity and Brightness sit
     100 → zeta ~0.20, lively, two visible rebounds

   Both ends shippable, which is the constraint that fixed the

/* ══ Gooey ════════════════════════════════════════════════
   What is left of the two library-surfaced components that
   used to live here: the measurement every liquid-gooey group
   on the bench needs. Liquid tabs and the Plus menu are gone;
   this is the part of them that turned out to be the reusable
   half, and Balance, the Selection list, the Humidity wheel
   and the Sleep dial all still call it.

   ── what the library actually does ──────────────────────
   The usual gooey effect runs blur + alpha-contrast over your
   real UI, which is why it is normally confined to decorative
   circles: text goes soft, images smear, and the contrast step
   eats shadows. liquid-gooey splits it in two. An SVG layer
   carries a silhouette of your elements and takes the whole
   filter; your actual DOM rides crisp on top of it, untouched.
   Same liquid, none of the tax — and it is the same discipline
   our own filter needs, since text under an alpha threshold
   loses its edges and then itself.

   ── the two patterns, which are not interchangeable ─────
   MORPH gives the library the position: pass x/y and it
   animates the element and the liquid together, so pieces that
   separate stay bridged until the goo can no longer hold them.
   The split IS the effect.

   MOVE gives the position to you: move the element however you
   like and the surface trails it as liquid rubber with a
   droplet tail. A filter has no memory of motion — a shape
   that crossed two pixels and one that crossed the whole track
   arrive identical — and this is the part that fixes that. */

/* ── the zoom correction, applied to someone else's SVG ──────
   liquid-gooey measures its items with getBoundingClientRect
   and draws them as SVG user units. Those are the same number
   only while no ancestor is scaled — and on this bench every
   component sits inside a scaled card, so the transform lands
   twice and the silhouette drifts from its element in
   proportion to both the scale and the distance from the
   origin. Measured: 0.1px at scale 1, 22px at 1.09, 124px at
   1.4.

   Everything the library computes is in screen px, so scaling
   its layer by 1/k converts the whole coordinate space back to
   layout px in one move, and the card's own transform then
   renders it correctly. Same k = rect.width / offsetWidth the
   rest of the bench uses.

   MOVE ONLY. Morph positions its items with a CSS transform on
   a real wrapper, in layout px, which scales correctly on its
   own — apply this there and you over-correct: the silhouette
   comes out 1/k the size of its button, so the blob is smaller
   than the element and every icon looks off-centre inside it.
   Measured on the plus menu: button 58px, blob 46px, and up to
   10px of offset. Without it, 58 and 58, dead on. */

/* ══ 1 · Balance ══════════════════════════════════════════
   A portfolio card. Pull it down to refresh, run along the
   line to read the day back.

   THE PART THAT MATTERS about the pull: the commitment happens
   at a DISTANCE, not on release. Crossing the threshold is
   what arms the refresh, so you know it will happen while your
   finger is still down — let go after that and it goes, and
   you knew. A version that decides on release has hidden the
   only information the gesture carries.

   ── the liquid, and why it is back ──────────────────────
   There was a metaball here once and it was removed, for a
   reason worth repeating: a droplet stretching off the top
   edge of a card says something far more elaborate than
   "working", which is a refresh indicator's whole job.

   What is here now is the opposite arrangement, and it earns
   the filter rather than decorating with it. Five droplets sit
   SCATTERED at rest and are drawn together as you pull —
   crossing the threshold is the moment they touch and fuse
   into one body. The goo is not an ornament on the commitment,
   it IS the commitment, readable at a glance and at a
   distance, which is exactly what this gesture needs to
   communicate. Then it opens back into a ring and turns while
   the work happens. It never leaves its own 44px. */

/* ── what it is refreshing ─────────────────────────────────
   Three fixed readings, cycled in order, each starting where
   the last one ended — so a refresh continues the day rather
   than resetting it, and a bench still gets the same
   screenshot twice.

   ONE ARRAY IS THE WHOLE TRUTH. The balance is the last point,
   the change is last minus first, and the percentage is that
   over the first. They were three hand-written figures beside
   a decorative line, which is three things that can disagree
   with each other and with the chart above them — and once the
   line became scrubbable, every point on it needed a real
   number anyway. */

   was actually buying — digits that do not shift width as
   they count — is available in Inter for free.

   font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums is that feature. Same
   advance for every digit, in the proportional face, so the
   number can change on a refresh or under a scrub without
   anything after it moving. Mono was never the requirement;
   a stable advance was.

   The comma comes back with it. The old note here argued for
   a comma over a thin space because in DM Mono a space is as
   wide as a digit and "59 102" reads as a number with a
   character missing. In Inter that no longer applies — but a

     off a fixed card before, with the bottom of the sheet
     disappearing under the card's own edge; a card that gives
     is what a pull is actually doing to it.

     It rides `sprung` and not `at`, which is the clamped one —
     and that unclamped tail is the bounce. The spring at tune
     58 is under-damped, so on the way home it goes PAST zero
     before it settles; clamping threw that away. Letting the
     card compress a few pixels below its resting height is the
     rebound, and it costs nothing but the room to do it in:
     SQUASH is padding the card carries at rest so there is
     something to give back.

     And the growth is CANCELLED IN LAYOUT by a matching
     negative margin in the stylesheet — see the note there.
     That is not tidiness: a card whose real height changed

                Rather than three backgrounds taking turns
                fading. Those are two different claims: a pad
                that lights up on one tab and goes out on
                another says "this one"; a shape that moves says
                "this one, and it came from that one" — and only
                the second reads as an object rather than as a
                state change.

                Placed by arithmetic, in CSS, and NOT by
                measuring: every tab is `flex: 1` so they are
                equal by construction, and a translate in
                percent of the pill's own width is exactly one
                tab per step. Which matters here more than
                usual, because the card is drawn at a fraction —
                anything that measured a rect would be reading
                scaled pixels and placing unscaled ones. */}
